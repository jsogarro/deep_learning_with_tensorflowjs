# Chapter 8 - Deploying Deep Learning Models to the Browser

In this chapter we will take the movie recommendation application that we created in the last chapter and will refactor it to make it ready for deployment. We will make use of the TensorFlow.js sessions and using the `tidy` method to clean up our environment after our models have been run.

## Summary

In this chapter we deployed the recommendation system that we created in the last chapter and made some improvements to ensure that our models run efficiently in a production environment. We used the `tidy` and `dispose` methods to clean up variables that were creating during the training process of our models.
